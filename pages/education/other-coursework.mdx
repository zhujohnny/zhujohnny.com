# Other Coursework

## Harvard University Extension

I enrolled in and completed 3 courses with the Harvard Extension School:

* **CS50: Introuduction to Computer Science**
* **CS51: Abstraction and Design in Computation**
* **CS171: Visualization**

[CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college) taught me the basics of computational thinking and programming in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), and covered topics such as data structures and algorithms, memory management, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and HTTP requests.
[CS51](https://cs51.io/) in [OCaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml), taught me the fundamental concepts of designing computer programs and abstraction. I became more familiar with different paradigms - including imprerative, functional, and object-oriented. 
Lastly, [CS171](https://www.cs171.org/) taught me tools to visualize large amounts of data using [D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D3.js). This course played a large part in teaching me how the human visual system processes and perceives images, and how to use software to communicate with users.

In my final project, I worked with another developer to analyze data from the [World Bank logistics performance index](https://lpi.worldbank.org/). The primary questions we wanted to answer were:
* What's a given countries ability to trade?
* With other countries? 
* Within region? 
* What direction is the country moving?

## Georgia Tech, Analytics MicroMasters

Through [edX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdX), I completed 3 graduate-level courses and earned a [MicroMasters](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/gtx-analytics-essential-tools-and-methods) certificate to count Georgia Tech's [Online Master of Science in Analytics](https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/analytics) degree.
* **Introduction to Analytics Modeling**
* **Computing for Data Analysis**
* **Data Analytics for Business**

I learned how to use statistical models and machine learning models for classfication, clustering, change detection, and prediction.
I also developed familiarity with industry tools such as [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) using [Jupyter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter) notebooks.

Here is an excerpt from my course project that analyzes how the New York mets could use statistical and machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor classification and k-means clustering to improve ticket sales, merchandise sales, and the fan exeperience.

## Hack Reactor

[Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/coding-bootcamp#Curriculum)'s 12-week immersive boot camp in San Francisco paved the way for me to transition full-time to software engineering following my time in business school.

As part of the curriculum, I deepened my understanding of frontend frameworks such as [React](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)) and [Angular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)), and improved my understanding of backend technologies such as [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js), [AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services) and [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)).
Below are two projects I worked on during my time there.

#### Frontend Capstone
Discovery app for local restaurant information and reviews, modeled after Yelp.

The project was an exercise in component design within a larger [microservices architecture](http://microservices.io/).
I personally built the [Restaurant Details](https://github.com/hrsf93-welp/welp-restaurant-details) component, a service provided to a parent restaurant page. The service implements a RESTful API on the backend to retrieve data from a MongoDB database.

*Technologies: JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS/Sass, Node.js, Express, Redis, MongoDB, Jest/Enzyme, Webpack, Docker, AWS EC2, Google Maps API, moment.js*

#### Backend Capstone
Scaled a crowdfunding application to handle more traffic, modeled after Kickstarter.

I horizontally scaled the application to 10 AWS [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) servers and implemented a [load balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/), allowing the application to handle 1 million requests in 2 minutes (5x traffic). 
I also implemented caching using [Redis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redis), and optimzed queries by [denormalizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormalization) data and [indexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index) columns to speed up page load times.
