# University of California, Berkeley
I obtained my **Master of Business Administration** at the Haas School of Business prior to beginning my career as a software engineer.
I focused my time in school on pursuing a career in the technology sector, working on several projects with real companies in [product marketing](#vmware), [product management](#series-b-saas-startup), and [design](#haaswork).

Ultimately, I decided that I wanted to be part of an engineering team in order to work on building software products through code. This page contains my non-engineering experience. If you're interested in my transition into a software engineering, you can read about it [here](other-coursework). 

## VMware
I interned in **product marketing** in the security and networking group called [NSX](https://www.vmware.com/products/nsx.html). 
My intern project was to work with our sales team and channel partners to find cross-sell opportunites for the NSX product from the vSphere install base. The main deliverables were:
1. A Partner Cheat Sheet to help the channel partners sell NSX.
2. A Tableau dashboard for each sales representative of customers who are most likely to buy NSX and the partners who are most likely to help to sell NSX.
3. Educating partners face-to-face at VMworld in Las Vegas and at a technical workshop in Austin.

## Series B SaaS Startup
As a **product manager**, I delivered a profile editing feature for a review aggregation tool. 
Business owners interested in creating a website with their aggregated reviews could edit information about their business before publishing the page.

This was my first experience in an agile environment, writing product requirements and working in JIRA.
I learned about the flow of information from the frontend to the backend, and collaborated with an engineer and a designer to ship the feature.

## Haas@Work
I led a 10-person **design consulting** team as part of an applied innovation course called [Haas@Work](https://designthinking.berkeley.edu/engage/innovationagency/).
Over the course of 16 weeks, our team came up with 3 novel concepts for how the client could grow their business. 

I managed the direct relationship with the client's strategy team with the assistance of a coach and led the team in market research, ideation, prototyping, and running a pilot of each of the ideas.
