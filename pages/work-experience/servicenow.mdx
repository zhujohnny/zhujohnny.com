# ServiceNow

ServiceNow is where I began my career as a full-time **Software Engineer** in 2018.

The company is a [platform-as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) provider that supports large enterprise organizations in managing their IT, Employee, Customer, and Creator workflows.

I started as an engineer with the core [IT Service Management](https://www.servicenow.com/products/itsm.html) organization. During my time with the team, I worked on the [Vendor Management Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/products/vendor-manager-workspace.html) web application and the [Now Mobile](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/now-mobile/id1469616608) and [ServiceNow Agent](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/servicenow-agent/id1446951408) mobile applications.

Given a new opportunity to be part of a newly formed team, I joined [NowX](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2021/06/30/up-6-nowx-could-justify-servicenows-18x-forward-revenue-valuation/) as the 4th engineer on team dedicated to the Manufacturing industry vertical. This team has since graduated from the NowX incubator, launched several products, signed several large customers, and been rebranded as the [Operational Technology Management](https://www.servicenow.com/products/operational-technology-management.html) group.

## Operational Technology
* Contributed to the architectural design and data model for **OT Foundation**. Implemented a primary feature to model relationships between factory equipment and hierarchical entities (e.g. a computer to the production line it operates)
* Built and owned the main landing page for **OT Visibility**, enabling users to view key metrics and data visualizations
* Led the end-to-end development of the first version of **OT Service Management**. The product allows users to raise and track tickets against OT assets and equipment inside manufacturing facilities.

* Collaborated with a team of 4 engineers to build a Zoom and Twilio integration for the **ServiceNow Agent** Application. Hosts are able to start calls from the app and invite team members to help resolve IT ticket issues
