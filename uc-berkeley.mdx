# University of California, Berkeley
I obtained my **Master of Business Administration** at the Haas School of Business prior to beginning my career as a software engineer.
I focused my time in school on pursuing a career in the technology sector, working on several projects with real companies in [product marketing](#vmware), [product management](#series-b-saas-startup), and [design](#haaswork).

Ultimately, I decided that I wanted to be part of an engineering team in order to work on building software products through code. This page contains my non-engineering experience. If you're interested in my transition into a software engineering, you can read about it [here](other-coursework). 

## VMware
I interned in **product marketing** in the security and networking group called [NSX](https://www.vmware.com/products/nsx.html).

## Series B SaaS Startup
As a **product manager**, I delivered a profile editing feature for a review aggregation tool. 
Business owners interested in creating a website with their aggregated reviews could edit information about their business before publishing the page.

This was my first experience in an agile environment, writing product requirements and working in JIRA.
I learned about the flow of information from the frontend to the backend and collaborated with an engineer and a designer to ship the feature.

## Haas@Work
I led a 10-person **design consulting** team as part of an applied innovation course called [Haas@Work](https://designthinking.berkeley.edu/engage/innovationagency/).
